# flutter_amplify
This project is about how can you integrate AWS amplify (& s3 storage) in flutter app and I hope you will like it.
using this I am going to show you that how you can (concept-) 1. install required software(like nodejs, npm, aws cli) in system for AWS amplify.  
2. Configure AWS amplify in flutter app  
3. Remove error or update sdk version in app to support this features.  
4. Add Auth and s3 storage bucket as a serverless backend that interfaces with flutter app.  
5. Perform curd operation on s3 bucket using app or in flutter app to update UI/functionality
